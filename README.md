RideShare
==========

This project was started at Earlham College as a result of the need to help students share rides between school and their homes in a more effective and efficient manner. The project was initiated as part of an independent study by Leif DeJong and Mark Pearson to figure out how to build an intuitive, adaptable, and easy-to-use system for sharing rides. The result was RideShare that has a Bootstrap front-end to take advantage of the UI features and a CodeIgniter back-end design to take advantage of the ease-of-use and speed of the framework. The long term goal of the project is to allow institutions or individuals to download this system and use it in whatever way they can in an attempt to reduce green house gases that contribute to global warming.
